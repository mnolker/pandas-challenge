Option 2: PyCitySchools Observable Trends

1. Charter schools have a higher percentage of students passing (>70%) Math & Reading than District schools based on the results in the Scores by School Type table results (90% overall passing for Charter vs 54% for District).  All the top 5 performing schools are Charter schools while all the bottom 5 performing schools are District School Type.
2. School budgets per student appear to be inversely correlated to student performance in the school;  The less a school's spending per student, the higher the overall passing %.
3. Testing does not have a lot of variability by grade within each school.  The average scores do not change much between the grades more than a couple of points between grades.
